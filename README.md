# Self_Balancing_Bot
In this project we aim to design, construct and implement the control of a two- wheel self-balancing robot using LQR Controller.

Two-wheeled self-balancing robot is a popular model in control system experiments which is more widely known as inverted pendulum and cart model. This is a multi-input and multi-output system which is theoretical and has been applied in many systems in daily use. 

There were few researches that focus on complete mathematical modeling and designing a controller for the system. In this project we aim to design, construct and implement the control of a two-wheel self-balancing robot using LQR Controller. The system consist a pair of DC motor, motor controller and Arduino 101 microcontroller board with inbuilt 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer, employed for vertical angle determination and encoders for drift and linear velocity determination. In addition, a complementary filter is implemented to compensate for accelerometer noise and gyro drifts. The controller was tested with different case of system condition practically and through simulation on Simulink and Matlab programming.
